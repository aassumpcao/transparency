\begin{abstract}
\noindent This dissertation project will investigate the relationship between legal sanctions and politics in Brazil. In the first paper, I look at the effect of convictions for electoral infractions on electoral performance in four municipal elections between 2004 and 2016. The second paper tests whether State Court judges significantly rule in favor of politicians involved in small claim court cases. Finally, the last paper investigates whether active and passive transparency simultaneously improve government performance and increase the number of legal sanctions for government wrongdoing. These papers contribute significantly to the literature in political science, economics, and law by exploring the relationship between legal sanctions and local political dynamics in developing countries. In addition, I also contribute new data sources in the form of judicial decisions and innovative identification strategies using institutional features of Brazilian electoral and judicial systems. \\

\section{Active and Passive Transparency in Brazilian Municipalities} \label{sec:paper3}

\subsection{Introduction} \label{subsec:introduction_paper3}

Institutional scholarship often claims that government transparency is a key factor for good governance and economic development \citep{KaufmannGovernanceMatters1999,BoRothsteinGoodGovernance2012}. When governments make their business public, they allow for the scrutiny and oversight of actions taken by elected officials and civil servants. In many countries, for instance, citizens can check the use of public resources by accessing expense reports filled by politicians and, if unhappy, demand proper use of government funds. Under these conditions, transparency creates an accountability mechanism aligning interests of agents and principals and further supporting economic and social progress. In recent debates about the impact of institutions on development, however, there is an increasing push for more granular understanding of these accountability mechanisms. Investigations on the endogeneity of institutions and their strength \citep{AcemogluChapterInstitutionsFundamental2005,LevitskyVariationInstitutionalStrength2009,DalBoInstitutionsBehaviorExperimental2010} are becoming more widespread and this project contributes to this scholarship as the first account of the simultaneous effects of \emph{active} and \emph{passive} transparency on government performance.

There are many studies looking at active and passive transparency separately. The former can be understood \emph{as any action initiated by government, or its partners, releasing information about government business}, of which top-down monitoring is the most important mechanism. Using experimental evidence from Indonesia, \citet{OlkenMonitoringCorruptionEvidence2007c} shows that delivering top-down audits of road construction projects with certainty reduces the amount of missing funds by eight percentage points, while grassroots community initiatives have no effect on the misallocation of public resources. \citet{FerrazExposingCorruptPoliticians2008b} investigate whether the release of corruption information via audits impacts the electoral performance of incumbent mayors in the Brazilian municipal elections of 2004. They find that stronger corruption allegations (as measured by the level of corruption revealed in the audit reports) significantly reduced the chances of incumbent reelection by as much as seven percentage points. In the presence of a local AM radio station, the impact increases to a 23 percentage point hit to the probability of reelection of incumbent mayors. \citet{BobonisMonitoringCorruptiblePoliticians2016} document a 67 percent reduction in corruption when municipalities in Puerto Rico undergo their timely audits before election period, and corroborates the evidence that top-down monitoring consistently prevents misallocation of resources.

The monitoring effect on corruption is present even when accountability comes from media coverage. \citet{CampanteIsolatedCapitalCities2014} show that isolated U.S.~state capitals have higher corruption levels, as measured by federal convictions for corruption-related crimes, due to the lower concentration of population and newspapers in and around their geographical area. This media monitoring effect does not only impact criminal behavior, such as corruption, but also non-criminal behavior, such as day-to-day political work. \citet{SnyderJrPressCoveragePolitical2010} use the geographical intersections of media markets and U.S.~congressional districts to isolate the effect of media coverage on political behavior. They find that representatives from districts where media coverage is larger are more aligned with their constituents' preferences, more likely to participate in congressional hearings, and to serve in committees directly relevant to their constituents. Though these studies  are conducted at different periods and across different countries, they jointly point to the same positive effect of active transparency on government accountability.

Passive transparency, on the other hand, has only recently become a topic of academic interest, so much so that it does not have a widely-accepted definition yet. To that end, I define it \emph{as any action initiated by government, or its partners, in which information is made available but released only upon request}. The key difference to active transparency is the information release component. In actuality, passive transparency has mostly taken the form of freedom of information acts (FOIAs). FOIAs constitute dormant accountability measures which are activated when there is an explicit request from the public, the media, or any other non-governmental agent. In one of the earlier analysis of freedom of information policies, \citet{EscalerasFreedominformationacts2010} find that passive transparency does not reduce corruption; in fact, in developing nations, their evidence is that implementing FOIAs actually \emph{increases} corruption. \citet{CostaFreedomInformationLaws2013} corroborates these findings with micro-level data from the World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, where she shows that after the adoption of FOI laws firms are eight to 12 percentage points more likely to perceive corruption as an obstacle to business. These studies, however, rely on corruption perception indexes and thus are susceptible to two simultaneous measurement errors: the increase in corruption could come from (i) FOIAs detecting more of otherwise uncovered corruption in \citet{EscalerasFreedominformationacts2010}, leading to (ii) firms perceiving more corruption in \citet{CostaFreedomInformationLaws2013}. Both cases are compatible with unchanged (or lower) levels of corruption. The results in \citet{CordisSunshineDisinfectantEffect2014} are more aligned with the expected relationship between passive transparency and corruption: using the same corruption (objective) measure of \citet{CampanteIsolatedCapitalCities2014}, federal convictions for corruption-related crimes, they find that U.S.~states switching from weak to strong FOIA institutions experience twice as many corruption detection and conviction cases.

To my knowledge, this is the first study bringing together active and passive transparency. At first, analyzing the joint effect of transparency might seem uninteresting. If separately these policies improve governance, either by looking at corruption or political behavior, and are both expressions of government accountability, then it is intuitive to conclude that both favor good governance and performance. A more nuanced reasoning, however, reveals interesting puzzling questions. In a world where government resources are scarce, authorities might perceive them as competing policies and choose the implementation of one over the other. As such, any analysis that directly compares the effect of each alternative is of great policy value. In addition, if we allow for heterogeneous behavior of individuals working in government, we can expect different reactions to the implementation of either policy, e.g.~they might fear audits more than FOIA requests. Finally, there are a number of recent studies looking at whether better informed voters can ensure better governance practices \citep{PandeCaninformedvoters2011,WintersLackingInformationCondoning2013,ChongDoesCorruptionInformation2015,Weitz-ShapiroCanCitizensDiscern2017}. An open question remains as to which type of transparency produces the most credible information for holding politicians and bureaucrats accountable for their actions.

I take advantage of an unique policy environment in Brazil to answer these questions. Between 2003 and 2015, the Office of the Comptroller-General (CGU) implemented a random audit program investigating the use of federal resources by municipalities across Brazil to implement local public policies. This program provides exogenous variation in active transparency for a random sample of municipalities during this period. In 2012, however, Brazil also enacted its Freedom of Information Act, known  \emph{in portuguese} as LAI, establishing channels of information release across all government levels. By overlaying random audits and LAI across municipalities over time, I artificially create a two-by-two factorial experiment where municipalities fall into one of four treatment arms: (i) control (municipalities not audited before LAI); (ii) passive transparency (municipalities not audited after LAI); (iii) active transparency (municipalities audited before LAI); (iv) active and passive transparency (municipalities audited after LAI). I then compare the effect of these treatments on government performance and sanctions applied to politicians and civil servants charged with wrongdoing between 2006 and 2018.

Besides the random audit policy, CGU also established a program in 2015 called \emph{Transparent Brazil Scale} (EBT), which measures the implementation of the freedom of information act across a random sample of municipalities via submission of homogeneous information requests to local governments. To the same extent as the corruption findings published in CGU reports,\footnote{As extensively discussed in \citet{FerrazExposingCorruptPoliticians2008b,FerrazElectoralAccountabilityCorruption2011a,BrolloPoliticalResourceCurse2013,ZamboniAuditRiskRent2018,FinanGovernmentAuditsReduce2018}.} the data collected in the EBT program forms an unbiased, objective measure of information quality when FOIAs are enacted -- precisely speaking to the credible information literature. Thus, using the outcomes from both CGU programs, I take one step further and provide estimates of the cross-effect of transparency, i.e.~the effect of active transparency on information quality and the effect of passive transparency on misallocation of resources.

Preliminary results are interesting.



The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: in section \ref{subsec:background_paper3}, I discuss the institutional design that allows for the causal identification of both active and passive transparency effects; section \ref{subsec:data_paper3} presents the data used in this project; section \ref{subsec:theory_paper3} suggests the theoretical mechanisms and hypotheses of the impact of various types of transparency on government performance; section \ref{subsec:methods_paper3} outlines the empirical strategy yielding the results in section \ref{subsec:results_paper3}; finally, section \ref{subsec:conclusion_paper3} concludes laying the groundwork for the conclusion of this project.
