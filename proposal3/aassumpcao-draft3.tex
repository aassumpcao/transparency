\begin{abstract}
\noindent This dissertation project will investigate the relationship between legal sanctions and politics in Brazil. In the first paper, I look at the effect of convictions for electoral infractions on electoral performance in four municipal elections between 2004 and 2016. The second paper tests whether State Court judges significantly rule in favor of politicians involved in small claim court cases. Finally, the last paper investigates whether active and passive transparency simultaneously improve government performance and increase the number of legal sanctions for government wrongdoing. These papers contribute significantly to the literature in political science, economics, and law by exploring the relationship between legal sanctions and local political dynamics in developing countries. In addition, I also contribute new data sources in the form of judicial decisions and innovative identification strategies using institutional features of Brazilian electoral and judicial systems. \\

\section{Active and Passive Transparency in Brazilian Municipalities} \label{sec:paper3}

\subsection{Introduction} \label{subsec:introduction_paper3}

Institutional scholarship often claims that government transparency is a key factor for good governance and economic development \citep{KaufmannGovernanceMatters1999,BoRothsteinGoodGovernance2012}. When governments make their business public, they allow for the scrutiny and oversight of actions taken by elected officials and civil servants. In many countries, for instance, citizens can check the use of public resources by accessing expense reports filled by politicians and, if unhappy, demand proper use of government funds. Under these conditions, transparency creates an accountability mechanism aligning interests of agents and principals and further supporting economic and social progress. In recent debates about the impact of institutions on development, however, there is an increasing push for more granular understanding of these accountability mechanisms. Investigations on the endogeneity of institutions and their strength \citep{AcemogluChapterInstitutionsFundamental2005,LevitskyVariationInstitutionalStrength2009,DalBoInstitutionsBehaviorExperimental2010} are becoming more widespread and this project contributes to this scholarship as the first account of the simultaneous effects of \emph{active} and \emph{passive} transparency on government performance.

There are many studies looking at active and passive transparency separately. The former can be understood as an action initiated by government, or by its partners, aiming at releasing information about government business, of which top-down monitoring is the most important mechanism. Using experimental evidence from Indonesia, \citet{OlkenMonitoringCorruptionEvidence2007c} shows that delivering top-down audits of road construction projects with certainty reduces the amount of missing funds by eight percentage points, while grassroots community initiatives have no effect on the misallocation of public resources. \citet{FerrazExposingCorruptPoliticians2008b} investigate whether the release of corruption information via audits impacts the electoral performance of incumbent mayors in the Brazilian municipal elections of 2004. They find that stronger corruption allegations (as measured by the level of corruption revealed in the audit reports) significantly reduced the chances of incumbent reelection by as much as seven percentage points. In the presence of a local AM radio station, the impact increases to a 23 percentage point hit to the probability of reelection of incumbent mayors. \citet{BobonisMonitoringCorruptiblePoliticians2016} document a 67 percent reduction in corruption when municipalities in Puerto Rico undergo their timely audits before election period, and corroborates the evidence that top-down monitoring consistently prevents misallocation of resources.

The monitoring effect on corruption is present even when accountability comes from media coverage. \citet{CampanteIsolatedCapitalCities2014} show that isolated U.S.~state capitals have higher corruption levels, as measured by federal convictions for corruption-related crimes, due to the lower concentration of population and newspapers in and around their geographical area. This media monitoring effect does not only impact criminal behavior, such as corruption, but also non-criminal behavior, such as day-to-day political work. \citet{SnyderJrPressCoveragePolitical2010} use the geographical intersections of media markets and U.S.~congressional districts to isolate the effect of media coverage on political behavior. They find that representatives from districts where media coverage is larger are more aligned with their constituents' preferences, more likely to participate in congressional hearings, and to serve in committees directly relevant to their constituents. Though these studies  are conducted at different periods and across different countries, they jointly point to the same positive effect of active transparency on government accountability.

Passive transparency, on the other hand, has only recently become a topic of academic interest, so much so that it does not have a widely-accepted definition in the social sciences. I define it \emph{as any government action that makes information available to citizens without an explicit request}.









(discuss puzzle of active and passive transparency... both are positive, but what about together? Pande 2011 informed voters).

(discuss contributions of this paper... questions, data, research design).

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: in section \ref{subsec:background_paper3}, I discuss the institutional design that allows for the causal identification of both active and passive transparency effects; section \ref{subsec:data_paper3} presents the data used in this project; section \ref{subsec:theory_paper3} suggests the theoretical mechanisms and hypotheses of the impact of various types of transparency on government performance; section \ref{subsec:methods_paper3} outlines the empirical strategy yielding the results in section \ref{subsec:results_paper3}; finally, section \ref{subsec:conclusion_paper3} concludes laying the groundwork for the conclusion of this project.
